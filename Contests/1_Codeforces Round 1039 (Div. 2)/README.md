### 🧠 Thought Process: Codeforces Contest Reflection

**Problem**: [Problem A - Recycling Center](https://codeforces.com/contest/2128/problem/A)

**Contest**: [Round 1039-Div2](https://codeforces.com/contest/2128)

**Status**: ✅ Pretests Passed

---

#### 🕰️ Context  
This was my return to Codeforces contests after quite a long break. I honestly didn’t come in with high expectations. My primary goal was simple — *just try to solve at least the first problem and walk away happy*.

---

#### 🧩 First Impressions  
The first problem looked like a minimization problem. Initially, I thought it might involve some form of dynamic programming — but I was skeptical because I assumed the time complexity needed would be too high.

---

#### 🔍 Key Observation  
Then I checked the constraints — and boom:  
> `n ≤ 30`  

That small constraint was a green flag. It told me brute-force was not only possible — it was *probably* intended.

---

#### 🛠️ Approach & Iterations  
I shifted to trying brute-force methods, trusting that I could discover a pattern. It wasn't a smooth ride — I had multiple trial-and-error attempts and a few failed pretest submissions. But I stuck with it, and eventually… it clicked.

---

#### ✅ Result  
The final solution passed pretests. It felt great — not because it was a hard problem, but because I trusted my gut, followed the trail of logic, and didn’t give up.

---

#### 💭 Takeaway  
Sometimes the real win isn’t the rank or the number of problems solved — it’s the mindset you bring. This problem reminded me that it’s okay to start small, trust your intuition, and grind through uncertainty.
